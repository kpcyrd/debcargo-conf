Release of $CRATE ready as a source package in ${BUILDDIR#$PWD/}. You need to
perform the following steps:

Build the package if necessary, and upload
==========================================

If the source package is already in Debian and this version does not introduce
new binaries, then you can just go ahead and directly dput the source package.

  dput ${DEBSRC}_${DEBVER}_source.changes

If this is a NEW source package or introduces NEW binary packages not already
in the Debian archive, you will need to build a binary package out of it. The
recommended way is to run something like:

  cd build
  ./sbuild-and-sign.sh $CRATE $VER
  dput ${DEBSRC}_${DEBVER}_${DEB_HOST_ARCH}.changes

See https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild for instructions on how to set it up. The
other tools are from the 'devscripts' package.

If the build fails e.g. due to missing Build-Dependencies you should revert
what I did (see below) and package those missing Build-Dependencies first.

Push this pending-release branch
================================

After you have uploaded the package with dput(1), you should push $RELBRANCH so
that other people see it's been uploaded. Then, checkout another branch like
master to continue development on other packages.

  git push origin $RELBRANCH && git checkout master

Merge the pending-release branch when ACCEPTED
==============================================

When it's ACCEPTED by the Debian FTP masters, you may then merge this branch
back into the master branch, delete it, and push these updates to origin.

  git checkout master && git merge $RELBRANCH && git branch -d $RELBRANCH
  git push origin master :$RELBRANCH

----

The above assumes you are a Debian Developer with upload rights. If not, you
should revert what I just did. To do that, run:

  git checkout master && git branch -D $RELBRANCH

Then ask a Debian Developer to re-run me ($0 $*) on your behalf. Also add your
crate to the "Ready for upload" list in TODO.rst so it's easy to track.
