Instructions
============

Run ``./update.sh <rust-crate-name>`` and follow its instructions.

(The above applies even for new Rust Debian packages.)

For now, the script assumes you cloned and built debcargo in ``../debcargo``,
so do that once before you run it.


TODO
====

maybe use --copyright-guess-harder
