Automatic update of $CRATE finished; now it's your turn to manually review it.

Deal with any FIXMEs mentioned above, by editing any corresponding source files
in $PKGDIR_REL. If a hint file is listed, indicated by (â€¢), you should edit the
*NON*-hint file, without the suffix .debcargo.hint, and git-add the hint file
exactly as output by debcargo. So for example:

to deal with a FIXME in:
	    build/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright.debcargo.hint
you should edit (and git-add when ready):
	    src/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright
and directly git-add without editing:
	    src/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright.debcargo.hint

When done, git-add all your changes plus any unmodified hint files, and re-run
this command (\`./update.sh $*\`).

For issues with debian/control, edit src/$PKGNAME/debian/debcargo.toml instead.
You can find docs for that in debcargo.toml.example in the debcargo git repo.

Check that your fixes actually get rid of the FIXMEs. Of course, you can ignore
FIXMEs listed in hint files, assuming you actually fixed the issues in the
corresponding non-hint files. (We have no way to auto-detect this so you have
to be honest!) You should also ignore the FIXME in the Distribution field in
the top entry of debian/changelog, that will be dealt with in the next step.

If there was a \`git diff\` above, check it to see if debcargo made changes to
any auto-generated hint files. If so, you should make the equivalent changes to
the non-hint files, and git-add these too.

When satisfied with the output, you can commit and push all your changes. Then,
ask a Debian Developer to run \`./release.sh $*\` to finalise your changes in
the changelog and build a release-ready .dsc in build/. Assuming it runs
successfully, they may \`dput\` the results afterwards. If you're not a Debian
Developer and are unable to upload, please don't run that script because it
will add inaccurate commits to git stating that the package has been uploaded.
