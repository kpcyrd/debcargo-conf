Automatic update of $CRATE finished; now it's your turn to manually review it.

Deal with any FIXMEs mentioned above, by editing any corresponding source files
in $PKGDIR_REL. If a hint file is listed, indicated by (â€¢), you should edit the
*NON*-hint file, without the suffix .debcargo.hint, and git-add the hint file
exactly as output by debcargo. So for example:

to deal with a FIXME in:
	    build/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright.debcargo.hint
you should edit:
	    src/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright
and git-add, without editing:
	    src/$PKGNAME/debian/copyright.debcargo.hint

When done, git-add your changes plus any unmodified hint files, and re-run this
command (\`./update.sh $*\`).

Check that your fixes actually get rid of the FIXMEs. Of course, you can ignore
FIXMEs listed in hint files, assuming you actually fixed the issues in the
corresponding non-hint files. (We have no way to auto-detect this so you have
to be honest!) You should also ignore the FIXME in the Distribution field in
the top entry of debian/changelog, that will be dealt with in the next step.

When satisfied with the output, you can commit and push all your changes. Then,
ask a Debian Developer to run \`./release.sh $*\` to finalise your changes in
the changelog and build a release-ready .dsc in build/. Assuming it runs
successfully, they may \`dput\` the results afterwards. If you're not a Debian
Developer and are unable to upload, please don't run that script because it
will add inaccurate commits to git stating that the package has been uploaded.
